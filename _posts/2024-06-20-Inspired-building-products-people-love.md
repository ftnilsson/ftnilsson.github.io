title: Inspired by Marty Cagan: Building Products People Love
---

If you’re in product management or part of a product team, Marty Cagan’s Inspired is a must-read. It’s packed with lessons on how to go beyond just delivering features to creating products that truly make a difference. Here’s what stood out to me:

## Key Points Summary

* It’s all about solving real problems. Successful products are valuable, usable, and feasible. Your job as a product manager? Make sure all three boxes are checked.
* Empowered teams win. The best teams are cross-functional, own outcomes, and have the freedom to innovate—way more fun and effective than just cranking out tasks!
* Discovery is the secret sauce. Talk to users, prototype, and test ideas early. This prevents wasting time on stuff nobody wants.
* Know your risks. Always ask: Is this valuable, usable, feasible, and viable for the business? Mitigating these risks upfront saves a ton of headaches.
* Culture matters. A great product team thrives on collaboration, trust, and a shared mission.

This book really shifted how I think about building products — it’s not just about delivery but discovery and impact.
 
In my career I can't say that I have had the pleasure to work in an environment that has a truly great product manager and a product focus that ensures that we really are *"Building Products People Love"*, but I would love to!

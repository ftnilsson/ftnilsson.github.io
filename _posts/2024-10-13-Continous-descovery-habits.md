Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres

Teresa Torres’ Continuous Discovery Habits is a game-changer for anyone building products. It’s a hands-on guide to embedding customer discovery into your team’s day-to-day work. Here are the takeaways that really clicked with me:

    Discovery isn’t a phase—it’s continuous. Successful teams don’t just research once and move on. They constantly engage with customers to uncover new insights and validate decisions.
    The Customer Interview habit. Torres suggests talking to customers weekly. Regular interviews keep you connected to their needs and help you avoid guesswork.
    Start with the outcome. Shift your mindset from delivering features to achieving measurable outcomes. Ask: “What behavior do we want to drive?”
    Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). This visual tool is a lifesaver! It helps map outcomes to opportunities and solutions, keeping your team focused on solving the right problems.
    Collaborate, don’t dictate. Involve the whole team—designers, engineers, and stakeholders—in the discovery process. Collaboration makes solutions stronger.
    Small bets, big learning. Torres emphasizes testing ideas through rapid experiments. Don’t aim for perfection—aim for learning.

This book inspired me to adopt a “discovery-first” mindset and weave customer input into every step of product development. It’s practical, insightful, and highly actionable.

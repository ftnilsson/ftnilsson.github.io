title: Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres
---

Teresa Torres’ Continuous Discovery Habits is a is a great read for anyone building products. It’s a hands-on guide to embedding customer discovery into your team’s day-to-day work by using/understanding/applying:

* Discovery isn’t a phase—it’s continuous. Successful teams don’t just research once and move on. They constantly engage with customers to uncover new insights and validate decisions.
* The Customer Interview habit. Torres suggests talking to customers weekly. Regular interviews keep you connected to their needs and help you avoid guesswork.
* Start with the outcome. Shift your mindset from delivering features to achieving measurable outcomes. Ask: “What behavior do we want to drive?”
* Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). This visual tool is a lifesaver! It helps map outcomes to opportunities and solutions, keeping your team focused on solving the right problems.
* Collaborate, don’t dictate. Involve the whole team—designers, engineers, and stakeholders—in the discovery process. Collaboration makes solutions stronger.
* Small bets, big learning. Torres emphasizes testing ideas through rapid experiments. Don’t aim for perfection—aim for learning.

This book would help anyone to adopt a “discovery-first” mindset and weave customer input into every step of product development. It’s practical, insightful, and highly actionable. 

As I said in the summary of [Inspired Building Products People Love](https://www.senordeveloper.net/Inspired-building-products-people-love/)
 I have never worked in a truly great product team that uses all these tools to continously descover and validate that we are building the correct thing.

Spring has sprung and 2024 is of to a great start. I have already completed one certification, AWS Serverless knowledge and being hungry for more knowledge I have piled up a few books that I want to read this year

## Key Points Summary

**In "Outcomes Over Output," Joshua Seiden urges businesses to prioritize understanding and influencing customer behavior as the primary metric for success. Key points include:**

* Customer-Centric Approach: Seiden emphasizes the importance of understanding customer needs and pain points to create solutions that drive desired behaviors.

* Outputs vs. Outcomes: While outputs are tangible deliverables like products or features, outcomes represent the meaningful changes in customer behavior resulting from these offerings. Success is measured by achieving desired outcomes.

* Shift in Focus: Instead of fixating on what a business produces, the focus should be on what it accomplishes. This requires delivering value beyond transactions.

* Real-World Examples: Seiden offers practical examples and strategies for identifying meaningful outcomes, measuring progress, and adjusting strategies based on customer feedback.

* Agility and Iteration: Businesses must be agile and iterate continuously to adapt to changing customer needs. Experimentation is encouraged, and failure should be viewed as a learning opportunity to foster innovation and resilience.

Overall, "Outcomes Over Output" guides businesses in prioritizing customer behavior to drive growth, differentiation, and long-term success.

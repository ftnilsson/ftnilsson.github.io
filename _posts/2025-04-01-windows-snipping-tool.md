Windows Secrets: Snip snip

Have you ever tried to try to take a screen shot of an expanded menu? It has been driving me crazy for ever and I ususally end up capturing the entire screen and then using an image/photo editing software to cut out the expanded menues. But no longer since I found this little hidden gem in windows 10/11 *Snipping Tool*

## Windows secrets

Micrsoft 10/11 both comes witha built in screen capture software called Snipping Tool and I use it frequently yo take screen grabs for documentation, blog posts and just charing with collegues

However taking a screen shot of an expanded menu can be troublesome becuse as you stop hovering over the menu to slect the snipping tool then the menu closes :sob: ... Fear not Microsoft got you covered! selecte the *"Delay your screen shot" button* and you can select the snipping tool to automatically capture the screen after 2, 5 or 10 second delay. Note that this needs to be done before you click "New"

After selecting delay, press the "New" button and switch to the application containing the menu you want to capture. expand and wait. After the delay the Snipping Tool will execute the screen shot and you can grab the menu :heart_eyes:

# Windows Secrets: Snipping Tool Hidden Gems

Have you ever tried to take a screenshot of an expanded menu? It has been driving me crazy forever, and I usually end up capturing the entire screen and then using an image/photo editing software to cut out the expanded menus. But no longer, since I found this little hidden gem in Windows 10/11: *Snipping Tool*

## What is the Snipping Tool?

Microsoft Windows 10/11 both come with a built-in screen capture software called Snipping Tool, and I use it frequently to take screen grabs for documentation, blog posts, or just sharing with colleagues.

You can access the Snipping Tool by:
- Typing "Snipping Tool" in the Windows search bar
- Using the keyboard shortcut **Win + Shift + S** (this opens Snip & Sketch in Windows 10 or the new Snipping Tool in Windows 11)
- Looking under Windows Accessories in the Start menu

## The Hidden Delay Feature: A Life Saver

However, taking a screenshot of an expanded menu can be troublesome because as you stop hovering over the menu to select the snipping tool, the menu closes :sob: 

**The solution:** Microsoft has got you covered! Select the *"Delay your screenshot" button* and you can set the snipping tool to automatically capture the screen after a 3, 5, or 10 second delay. Note that this needs to be done before you click "New".

### How to use the delay feature:

1. Open Snipping Tool
2. Select your preferred delay time (2, 5, or 10 seconds)
3. Click the "New" button
4. Switch to the application containing the menu you want to capture
5. Expand the menu you want to capture
6. Wait for the delay to complete
7. When the screen dims, select the area you want to capture :heart_eyes:

## More Snipping Tool Features You Might Not Know

The Snipping Tool is more powerful than most people realize:

- **Multiple capture modes**: Rectangle, free-form, window, or full-screen
- **Annotation tools**: Use pens, highlighters, and erasers to mark up your screenshots
- **Quick copy to clipboard**: The "Copy" button instantly places your screenshot on the clipboard
- **Sharing options**: Send your snips directly to email or other apps without saving them first

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Make your screen capturing even faster with these keyboard shortcuts:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Open Snipping Tool | Win + Shift + S |
| Delay timer | Alt + D |
| New snip | Ctrl + N |
| Save snip | Ctrl + S |
| Copy snip | Ctrl + C |

## Conclusion

The Snipping Tool's delay feature is just one example of how Windows has useful features hiding in plain sight. Next time you need to capture that tricky dropdown menu or tooltip, remember this handy delay option and save yourself the frustration of editing screenshots afterward.
